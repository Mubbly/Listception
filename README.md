# Listception

A personal React + TypeScript + SCSS project to learn more about React.

# Idea

The point is, as the name suggests, that you can create lists about anything and put **lists inside lists**. And more lists inside those lists. And so on. What a surprise, right?
Feel free to create TODOs, shopping lists, lists of books to read, concerts you’ve been to and whatever else comes to mind - all in one place. 

Later there might also be an option to add pictures, links and other things to each list item as well as make shared lists with reminders.
